<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
	This is the DOCTYPE it's the same for all HTML5 documents.
	It tells the browser that you want to speak in HTML and
	also says that you are using the latest versoin called
	HTML 5!
-->
<html lang="en">
	<!--
		html is the root element of the document, it comes
		from the roots of where HTML came from called SGML.

		we've included a special attribute called lang, the lang attribute
		is short for language and tells the browser what language our page is
		written in.  In this case we are using english and so we put en if for
		example your page was written in french you might put lang="fr"
	-->
	<head>
		<!--
			everything inside here is invisible to the user.  We use
			this section to bring in files, and styles as well as
			provide information about our document!
		-->
		<title>Flipping a card with jQuery!</title>
		<!--
			this title shows in the tabs or title bar,
			and is also used when bookmarking a site!
			Try loading this page and pressing ctrl+B to see it in action
		-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css" />
		<!--
			I've used something called a link to include my CSS stylesheet
			in my document.  CSS can be embedded however it is best
			practice to keep it seperate like we have done here!
		-->
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<!--
			The above code is called a meta tag.  A meta tag is a type of tag
			that passes special information about our page to the browser.
			in this case we are passing what's called a charset.

			A charset is just a fancy word for the letters, numbers, and symbols
			your webpage contains.  99.9% of the time you can use UTF-8 and can
			simply copy and paste the above code exactly.  You may need to use a
			different charset if you are going to write your webpage using a
			a different langugage (not to be confused with programming language)
			such as in Japanese or Chinese which use special characters.

			You'll notice above that I have assigned an id attribute to my paragraph.
			id's are used as a unique identifier for an element and can only be used
			once on a page.

			You'll notice I have added my Javascript files at the bottom.
			The reason for this is performance.  When you load a website all of
			the files associated with it (images, and code) have to be downloaded also
			the browser downloads these in the order they appear, so we keep our
			Javascript at the bottom and use a technique called progressive
			enhancement to make the user experience better!
